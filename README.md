# sample .NET 8 console app using NuGet pythonnet package and Python XmlSchema library for XSD 1.1 validation

You need to make sure you have Python 3 (e.g. Python 3.12) installed and set the path to the relevant dll as an environment variable e.g. in
my sample setup the environment variable `PYTHONNET_PYDLL` points to the local `C:\Users\marti\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python312.dll` installation dll.

Furthermore, in the local Python installation install the XmlSchema library with e.g. `python -m pip install xmlschema`.
